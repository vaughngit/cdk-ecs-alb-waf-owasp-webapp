# AWS Firewall Manager with WAF Integration

This document explains the implementation of AWS Firewall Manager to centrally manage AWS WAF rules across your organization.

## Overview

The solution implements a comprehensive security architecture using AWS Firewall Manager to centrally manage and enforce AWS WAF rules across multiple resources in your AWS organization. This approach provides consistent security controls and simplifies management of web application security at scale.

## Architecture Components

### 1. IP Sets
- **Allowed IP Set**: Defines IP addresses that are explicitly allowed to access the application
- **Blocked IP Set**: Defines IP addresses that are explicitly blocked from accessing the application

### 2. Custom Rule Group
A WAF rule group containing custom rules:
- **Allow List Rule**: Allows traffic from specific trusted IP addresses
- **Block List Rule**: Blocks traffic from known malicious IP addresses
- **SQL Injection Rule**: Blocks SQL injection attempts in query parameters

### 3. AWS Managed Rules
The solution incorporates AWS managed rule groups:
- **Amazon IP Reputation List**: Blocks requests from IP addresses associated with bots and threats
- **AWS Common Rule Set**: Provides protection against common web application vulnerabilities

### 4. Firewall Manager Policy
A centralized policy that:
- Applies WAF rules consistently across all Application Load Balancers
- Enables automatic remediation for non-compliant resources
- Centralizes logging configuration

## Implementation Details

### WAF Components

The solution creates the following WAF components:
- IP Sets for allow/deny lists
- Custom rule group with specific security rules
- Web ACL with both custom and AWS managed rules
- Logging configuration to CloudWatch Logs

### Firewall Manager Components

The Firewall Manager configuration includes:
- Security policy for WAF that applies to Application Load Balancers
- Account scope configuration to determine which accounts are affected
- Automatic remediation settings
- IAM role with necessary permissions

## Deployment Flow

1. The ECS stack deploys the application infrastructure including VPC, ECS cluster, and ALB
2. The WAF stack creates WAF resources and associates them with the ALB
3. The Firewall Manager stack creates a policy to centrally manage WAF rules

## Prerequisites

To use AWS Firewall Manager, your AWS environment must meet these requirements:
- AWS Organizations must be set up with all features enabled
- A Firewall Manager administrator account must be designated
- AWS Config must be enabled for all accounts in the organization

## Benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Manage WAF rules from a single location
- **Consistent Security**: Ensure all resources have the same security controls
- **Automated Compliance**: Automatically remediate non-compliant resources
- **Simplified Operations**: Reduce the operational burden of managing security at scale

## Monitoring and Logging

All WAF and Firewall Manager activities are logged to CloudWatch Logs, allowing you to:
- Monitor security events
- Track blocked requests
- Analyze traffic patterns
- Generate compliance reports

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Rule Updates**: Review and update IP sets and rules regularly
2. **Testing**: Test rules in monitoring mode before enforcing them
3. **Logging Analysis**: Regularly analyze logs to identify potential threats
4. **Least Privilege**: Apply the principle of least privilege to Firewall Manager roles
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation of custom rules and exceptions up to date
